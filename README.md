# Rust in raytracer

This project implements the beginnings of a raytracer as an exploration of writing Rust. The
current implementation supports only spheres, and implements only hit detection with no bouncing
of rays, so it's not a particularly powerful raytracer, but we love it all the same. Perhaps
something to revisit in the future, maybe in a more structured way by following
